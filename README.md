# JavaScript Deep Dive

This repository is a comprehensive JavaScript learning resource developed during my time as an instructor at a coding bootcamp.  
It was used to guide students through the core, advanced, and applied aspects of JavaScript with structured topics, code examples, and practice projects.

## Overview

The material in this repository is organized to follow a progressive learning path from foundational JavaScript concepts to advanced programming patterns and real-world use cases.  
It was designed to support classroom sessions, hands-on labs, and self-paced study.

## Repository Structure

- **01-Core/** — Core JavaScript concepts: variables, functions, loops, scope.
- **02-OOP/** — Object-Oriented Programming: objects, prototypes, classes.
- **03-DOM/** — DOM manipulation and event handling.
- **04-Advanced/** — Closures, callbacks, promises, and more.
- **05-This/** — Understanding the `this` keyword in various contexts.
- **06-StrictMode/** — Deep dive into JavaScript strict mode.
- **07-Fetch/** — Using the Fetch API and working with asynchronous data.
- **08-Projects/** — Mini-projects applying the learned concepts.

## Purpose

- Serve as a structured, classroom-grade curriculum for JavaScript learners.
- Provide reference-quality examples and explanations.
- Support bootcamp-style interactive sessions and practical coding challenges.

## Usage
